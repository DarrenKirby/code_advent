# Advent of Code
My solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges.

I only discovered this in 2024, so I did those puzzles in Python, my strongest language.
Since then, I've been using each previous year to check out or refresh other languages. 

* 2015: Julia
* 2016: Bash
* 2017: Ruby
* 2018: Kotlin
* 2019: C++
* 2024: Python
