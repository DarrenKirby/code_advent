# Advent of Code
My solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges.

I discovered AoC in 2024 and have contemporously written puzzles in Python, my strongest language.
I've been using previous years to check out or refresh other languages. In 2026 I started solving
the 2021 puzzles in Cozenage, a Scheme-derived lisp interpreter that I wrote myself in C.
